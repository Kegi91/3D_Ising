All the outputs of the runs are saved in this directory. The outputs of new runs
are saved by default in files runX.dat, where X represents the Xth lattice that is
run. A single file contains the physical quantities that are calculated, for a
single lattice, at all the different temperatures.

A single line of the output is of following format:

<E>	<E^2>	<|M|>	<M^2>	<M^4>	C	X	T

E = Energy
M = Magnetization
C = Heat capacity
X = Magnetic susceptibility
T = Temperature
