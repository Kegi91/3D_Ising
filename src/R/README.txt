This directory contains the R script that estimates the confidence interval of the
mean of the critical temperatures. This is done by using 10^4 bootstrap replicates.

To run the script, one must give execution permission for the file bootstrap.R. 
Giving the permission and running the script can be done with commands:

chmod 777 bootstrap.R
./bootstrap.R
